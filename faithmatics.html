							<h2>[2017/6/3]Why the move?</h2>
								<p>Some of you who actually follow my blog might be asking why I moved from hosting on Wordpress to just having my own website.</p>

								<p>All in all, I don't really have any good reasons. Wordpress is actually fine. It can embed images, easily link my blog pages (which currently I can't do yet, but hey, work in progress right?), and it works, while my website......well kind of doesn't.</p>

								<p>But having a functional website isn't what I'm exactly going for right now. I just want a great place to present the work that I'm doing, and I realized that to publicly showcase my work would require me to make more and more domains that I don't necessarily want. So I decided, instead of having several websites to talk do my blog, personal code projects, interests, hobbies, and other things, I'd make my own playground. And github.io is the best place to do it. Free, public (because it's not like I care if anyone can see my source code), and easy to access from any of my computers through source coding. So this is the route I am taking. If you just want to see my blog, that's fine! I'll try not to push any of my other projects onto this one. But if you want to see what else I do that isn't blogging, you can see it here. Hope you enjoy.</p>
								
								<p><b>Note:</b> Because even this website is a project I'm working on, at times things might change, until I get down to a format I am comfortable with. So sometimes it might even be broken!</p>
								
								<p>Regards, <br>Mark</br></p>

							<h2>[2017/6/3]The scandal of grace</h2>
								<p>I don't play much poker. Nor do I think I am or would be very good at the game. But sometimes I do like to watch poker videos and see players play. And after watching games for a time in my life, I have noticed that maybe we could learn something from poker players/gamblers in our own lives.</p>

								<p>In poker, specifically Texas Hold 'em. Each player playing is dealt 2 cards, which are called hole cards. These cards are visible to the players individually. Then there are 3 cards flipped into the center, which all players are allowed to use to make poker hands. These three cards are called the "Flop." Another card is flipped, called the "turn," and then a fifth and final center card called the "river." From the moment you get your hole cards, you are allowed to choose whether or not you would like to continue playing the round, or if you would like to fold your hand and the opportunity to win this pot. This offer as well as the offer to bet is given consecutively at the flop, turn, and river before finally a reveal of cards of all the players to see who would win the winnings from that round.</p>
								
								<hr />
								
								<p>I would like to play a scenario of poker. You as the player, the Devil is the other player, and God is the dealer. And your hole: A 3 of heart and a 7 of spades. Not a promising hand. But at least there is a potential for a straight. So maybe you play it out. The flop: A 3 of diamond, King of spades, and 4 of heart. Not promising. You have a pair of threes, and still a potential for a straight. But it would be likely to fold here right? The devil looks confident. Showing no sign that he is backing down. Maybe even raising the stakes on you. Could he be bluffing? Or was he sure he had something better. </p>

								<p>But no. God, the dealer, gives you that look. The look that says play. The look that says you can keep going. Maybe even a slightly nudge to see the game to the end. So you do. The turn: a 5 of diamond. As if the straight was coming to you all along. That it was meant to be this way. So you call the devils raise. And the river comes. And. it's. An Ace of spades. Nothing. No straight. No real hands. Just a pair of 3s to show for yourself. </p>

								<p>But God tells you that look of victory. Like everything is okay. And you are just ready to give up. And internally, you are wondering to yourself why you would listen. He handed you one of the worst pairs on the entire deck, and yet you are expected to be able to play in victory.</p>

								<p>But upon playing the board and ending the round, you reveal your pair of 3s, only to find that the devil has been bluffing you the entire game. He has nothing. Just a jack and a 10. And you win with just a measly pair of 3s.</p>

								<p>Sometimes in life we find ourselves asking why God didn't make us better, stronger, smarter, more equipped. We want to play out life like we have grinding 10 levels above our trials to prove that none of it is difficult or challenging. But what if that's not Good wants. He doesn't want us to be overpowered, or to be overleveled. God doesn't need you to be a royal flush. Maybe He only needs you to be a pairnof 3s. In any given game of poker, a pair of 3s won't win every game. It won't even win most games. But when used correctly, it surely can win a game at the right time.</p>

								<p>While thinking about this analogy, one thing bothered me about it. The fact that God is the dealer. That's like cheating because God as the dealer to play out the board. But as I thought about it more, the more it made sense to me. God has to be the dealer. And the reason why is grace. Grace is the biggest cheat code in this game. Grace is the reason why we are able to experience victory. Grace is the reason why a pair of 3s can win a game. Therefore, grace is truly the greatest scandal of all. And yet, that is exactly what God desires. For us to live out our scandals proudly. So today I hope you experience victory in the scandal that is grace in your life. </p>

							<h2>[2017/4/22]Battling the sin, not the sinner</h2>
								<p>I like to listen to the radio on my way to work sometimes. Usually that either consists of npr, or traffic stations. And one of the things that I like about npr is that they tend to format their stories as story telling, as opposed to trying to sell you an interesting article title. One of my most recent listens that I enjoyed involved drug addiction in Portugal, and how decriminalizing drug addiction has positively affect people. I highly recommend listening to the ~4 min audio or reading the transcript before continuing further.</p>
								<p><a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2017/04/18/524380027/in-portugal-drug-use-is-treated-as-a-medical-issue-not-a-crime" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">http://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2017/04/18/524380027/in-portugal-drug-use-is-treated-as-a-medical-issue-not-a-crime</a></p>

								<hr />

								<p>During my time being a Christian, and being highly involved in my church community during my time in college, I noticed a culture that I wanted to change, but I wasn't sure how to describe it until now. And it was the culture of secretly judging people we label as "less holy." Now you probably don't use that term, or call address people that way explicitly, but unconsciously, many of us do it.</p>

								<p>I see it in the behavior and mindset of so many college students. They don't want to do the things that other view as "sinful" or "unholy," hiding their shameful things and making a concerted effort to create a facade that appears as if they are doing all the right things, but internally struggle, and often times break from the church whether by pressure or by guilt. Others don't care to hide their actions, and quickly get ostracized by others in the church. And I come back to this one burning question as a Christian. Why are we (the church) driving these people away? Why are we denying them ministry? And what can we do to do to prevent that from continuing to be our mindset?</p>

								<p>The Bible paints a perfect picture of this in the Gospels by, yes you guessed it, the Pharisees. Strongly law-driven Jews who did not want to associate with the sinful and unclean. Mark 2:17, Jesus states that he is present not for the healthy, but for the sick, and in Luke 15:2, the Pharisees mutter about how Jesus invites sinners and tax collectors to dine with him. Although spiritual fellowship cannot be necessarily done with those who do not faith, Jesus fellowships with sinners for the purpose of bringing them closer to God, regardless of social status.</p>

								<p>Often, I feel that we feel more comfortable being like the Pharisees, keeping within the circle of people who know, listen to, and follow law. But is that what Jesus wanted from us? To be comfortable being surrounded by the "holy huddle"?</p>

								<p>So what is my proposal? A reversal of how we treat our community groups. To not treat sinfulness as a poison to avoid and reject, but as an opportunity to lift up those who might be struggling. To openly accept the confessions of those who have real sin struggles, and instead of ignoring, to help. To not criminalize people, but to urge improvement, help, and true counsel.</p>

							<h2>[2017/4/9]<del>Lead</del> Follow</h2>
								<p>This post was directly inspired by a shirt text that I noticed at Walmart this past Saturday. And as I crossed paths with this shirt, immediately so many thoughts came into my mind. The first being how much I disagree with the message that this shirt delivers.</p>

								<p><img class="  wp-image-152 aligncenter" src="https://faithmatics.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/img_20170408_170533.jpg" alt="IMG_20170408_170533" width="410" height="547" /></p>

								<p>As you can see, they have both the words Lead and Follow written along the front of the shirt. Except follow is crossed out, while lead is put into large letters displayed above the follow. This is a message that many of us grew up with, particularly so if you grew up as an Asian-American with parents who strove to push you academically.</p>

								<hr />

								<p>When you joined a school club, you were probably told that if you weren't a council member, the president, or the captain, then was it worth joining at all. Or that you needed to be the best, and that leading was the thing worth putting on your college application, because being a member just means you were part of it but didn't do anything. To me, that's what this shirt said.</p>

								<p>But if everyone became a leader, who is following? If we are all told to pursue titles and headlines, who will be there to read them? At the end of the day, we will only have leaders fighting to have position and power over their peers, because THEY want to be the one leading, not following. Without followers, no work would get done.</p>

								<p>Rather than telling our future generations that they should only be leaders and feel dissatisfied if they are not, let's tell them to find where they fit best in life. Sometimes, that means leading, sometimes that means agreeing with leaders, and sometimes that means being just a follower.</p>

								<p>Let me show another set of images to show what I mean:
								<br>The first is an example of ducks waddling through a pond in a row. The leader is mom, while the babies follow behind. Ultimately, everyone is following the mother, but there's another element to it. Every ducking behind the first is following not just the mother, but a duckling. And no one has a problem with the order. No one is fighting to take control of a certain place in line, because not only are they satisfied with it, they know that the destination is the same, the place that mother is taking them. One day, each of these ducklings may come to own their own line, but at this moment and time, they are followers, and that is not a problem.</br></p>

								<p><img class="  wp-image-151 aligncenter" src="https://faithmatics.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/ducks-in-a-row.jpg" alt="ducks-in-a-row" width="519" height="346" /></p>
								<p>The second is a picture of birds in the V formation. Similarly to the ducklings, everyone is placed in a spot. Their roles are similar in structure, but their placement is different. Everyone is contributing to the goal of energy efficiency in migration. They have the same goal, same purpose, but their placement, function, and personal actions maybe slightly different.</p>

								<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-153 aligncenter" src="https://faithmatics.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/screen-shot-2014-10-12-at-4-29-29-pm.png" alt="Screen-Shot-2014-10-12-at-4.29.29-PM" width="460" height="288" /></p>
								<p>Now everyone is in charge of their position at some point in life. People move on, pass away, and leave, and their place must be taken. But is it appropriate to kick someone out of that place before the appointed time? Maybe sometimes, but more than often, probably not. Instead of breaking down empires to build our own, let's build our empires to accomplish the ultimate purpose, whatever that may be.</p>

								<p>I closing I will say this. Not everyone is meant to lead. Not everyone is asked to lead. And not everyone is needed to lead. Whether you own the title or not, you play an important role where you are, and without even realizing, you might be leading those behind you.</p>

							<h2>[2017/3/11]If you can't confront me, then you don't love me</h2>
								<p>I imagine most of us have come across Physics in our lives, and have learned some basic concepts of Physics from our classes, or maybe our universities. Well one thing you learn when you begin to understand Physics is that without friction, we wouldn't be able to walk. In a perfect world that has no friction, the only way for objects to move would be to have an external force come and act upon an object. This would render us unable to walk because even if we tried, we would be stuck in place unable to push on the ground. However, because of friction, the force from our feet pushing against the ground and the ground pushing against our feet (but not moving because the total mass of ground beneath us being much greater than our mass), we are able to make movements forward.</p>

								<hr />

								<p>When I hear my peers talk about moments that they faced where someone said something ridiculous or even wrong, a lot of the time I tend to get a story that involves holding back words because they wanted to be loving. As if to be a loving person meant to refrain from any use of words that would potentially offend someone. That confrontation was something to avoid rather than embraced. I forgot, don't agree with that. I would say that there are some instances where refraining from speaking is better because it is emotionally driven, but at its core confrontation is not unloving. In fact, it can potentially be one of the most loving things that you can do for someone.</p>

								<p>I'm not trying to redefine love. I am not here to say that you don't know love. But I'd like to think that in love, to be confrontational is to be loving. Where do I get that? Jesus is confrontational.</p>

								<p>In the scene where Jesus meets the rich young ruler (Mark 10:17-31 & Matthew 19:16-25). the rich young ruler knows that he is a pretty stand up guy. He bears no irresponsible habits, doesn't swindle people of money, is a family man, and seems to have his life in order. And he asks Jesus for the answer to eternal life. But instead of being told that he has everything going for him, Jesus points out the one idol in this mans life. His riches. I'd take it a step further and even identify his status. This dude probably thought that all too well with the things that he has, he is doing everything he needs to do the way it needs to be done. That's what he wanted to hear. But that's not the answer he was given.</p>

								<p>Instead he is confronted with the one thing that he desires most to keep in the world. And that disappoints him. Because even though nothing else entices him, he still has one thing yet that he has not relinquished to the God. And needless to say, he didn't take the criticism very well. He rather walked away rather deflated by the fact that he owned great possessions and did not want to part with them (I don't think his disappointment was wrong, but I think his immediate response is very telling that he was not ready to make such a big commitment or consider it in that moment and time).</p>

								<p>We won't hear about this man again, but one thing that I wonder is after he processed this information, how did he respond? Did he eventually decide that pursuing eternal life in heaven was not worth losing his possessions over? Or did he realize that Jesus had given him wisdom worth accepting. Only the Lord knows.</p>

								<p>Confrontation is hard. It can be painful to hear, and be something that we don't want or expect from our loved ones. But I would like to think that it's loving because it makes us think. Without confrontation about our problems or issues, we wouldn't think about our shortcomings because unless we are constantly thinking, life will go on exactly the same as it has been until this point. So I willingly accept confrontation, and will openly confront those I love in wisdom. Because I hope that through it, a heart that is for the Lord will continue to sprout in my peers.</p>

							<h2>[2017/2/12]Lakes stand still, but Rivers flow</h2>
								<p>What is the longest you have waited for something to happen in your life?
								<p>I'd take a gander to say that most you have not really waited that long for something to happen in your life, or to get the thing you wanted to have most.</p>

								<p>Atlanta was crazy about making it to the super bowl. That they were finally able to get there again since 1999. The opportunity as something finally happening.</p>

								<p>Another example of someone who waited for a long time. Jihyo from Twice. For those who know, she waited 10 years to be able to debut in Twice, one of the most exciting life events for her in her life.</p>

								<p>If you ever listen to Jihyo live, you can see the fruits of her labor. She is a really good singer. Do I think she is the most amazing singer in Korea? No and I don't think that's what her dream is, but she definitely accomplished what she had set her sights out to do, and that was to debut as a singer in a girl group. And yeah it took her 10 years to finally do so, but she had the patience and preparation to stick it out for that amount of time.</p>

								<p>What does it mean to wait? I can't say that I can really waited that long for things, especially when compared to how long others have waited. I'm currently "waiting" for marriage. Waiting for the job that has everything that I want from it. Waiting for God to show me my life calling. Waiting for an opportunity to speak loud and proud about my faith. Waiting and a lot of it. And some of these things I've been waiting for for years. But if there is anything that I have learned about waiting, it's that it's not idle. It's not still, or stagnant, or stale. It moves.</p>

								<hr />

								<p>I say this because everyone around me seems to think that waiting is this inactive thing. Something that takes a lot of effort, but somehow is a very passive action. At JCA we had a speaker come to Quest who shared about his life experiences, except he described waiting as an action. Always acting in a way that would prepare him for the next stage in life. And the most amazing part was that he did this uncertain of what the next step would be.</p>

								<p>So many people are confused as how to describe the current problem with millennials like myself. I'm not claiming to have any answers, and definitely struggle with some of the same exact things that my millennial peers do as well. I want to change the world, and have grown up my entire life being told that I was supposed to be doing great and amazing things as soon as I get my opportunity. But quickly, these months of work has shown me that that is definitely not true.</p>

								<p>Some people work really hard for a really long time to get to the place that they want to be. Some doing the same thing for so long that it becomes comfortable. For the Falcons, it was going season in and season out either not being able to make it to the Superbowl, let alone making it very deep into the playoffs. For Jihyo, it was being just a "trainee" for a decade before finally making her debut into Twice. And as individuals we can get sick of what we are doing. It get's repetitive, tiring, and hopeless. But if you have a dream, a goal, a place in life that you want to get to, then work hard for it. But never stop being ready. Ready at any moment to stake your claim and say that it is your time to rise to the challenge given to you.</p>

								<p>Right now that's where I am in life. The work I'm doing is great, and the environment I am living in is satisfactory, but there is a work I am looking for and a place I want to live. I'm waiting for my opportunity. But I'm not just going to sit around and just "do my job." It would be a shame of me to just sit around and wait for my opportunities, only to watch them pass by because I wasn't ready. Being in a state of waiting does not mean that you are not ready for what is to come, so in my state of waiting, I am also preparing myself for what is to come in front of me. So I will close with an analogy that I think describes what it looks like to wait.</p>

								<p>Lakes don't move. Lakes are a body of water that stay in the same place, because nothing passes through it. Sometimes we live our lives that way. Idle and waiting. Isolated and away from the body of water that we want to be in, which is the ocean. But rivers move. They flow, they crash, they confront the obstacles in from of them and force new ways to move. That's just how rivers are. I think for many of us we think of waiting as this big lake that doesn't move. It doesn't change and it doesn't transform until an external force, like a river, comes to change its circumstances. But who are we to say that we should sit around and do nothing while we wait. Why not be the river, maneuvering and making our way through current and stream, still waiting, but waiting for the end point that we all know is surely coming at the Grand ocean. Be river, not a lake.</p>

							<h2>[2017/1/22]The Holy Zone</h2>
							<p>I used to listen to a lot of K-pop. I don't anymore because either time, level of interest, or I'm just picky about what I want to listen to, but I am a strong Once (follower of a girl group named Twice). The group was actually formed from a Survival show called "Sixteen," where all the girls competed with one another and other girls to get a spot into the group that would be Twice. And one of my favorite segments from that show was the following lecture given by CEO Park Jin Young. I'm sorry if you're not Korean, the links I share don't have English subs.</p>
							<p>Timestamp (1:29-2:55): <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYpQ_no133g" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYpQ_no133g</a></p>

							<hr />

							<p>- "I need time to be holy for church"
							<br>- "I would do ___, but can't because it's Sunday you know?"</br>
							- "That would be something I would do/say but gotta be holy you know?"
							<br>- "Why are you trying to be so holy? This isn't church/small group."</br></p>

							<p>These or any similar phrase might be something you have heard from fellow Christians at some point in time. I know I have. And I've come to describe this phenomenon as the "Holy Zone Model."</p>

							<p>This model is based on this idea that there is a space to be "holy" and a space to be "secular." These spaces have some overlap (ie. friend groups, interests, activities), but they do no coexist or occupy the same space. They are separated. Kind of like a Venn diagram. And to you reader, it pains me to say this but if you have been living a way of life that sounds like, or is conducive to what I have just described, then you have a inaccurate view of God, the Church, and your faith.</p>

							<p>I cannot claim to speak for all the people around me who use Holy Zone Model phrases, but regardless of the reason, I believe that those who do live this way have a view of God, and a view of the world, and actively choose to say that those things do not come together. So in the face of potential persecution -- such as sharing the Gospel with co-workers, hanging out with friends outside of church, or meeting someone new and wondering if you should bring up the word "Church" -- they run away from the potential that God wants to work through them anytime anywhere anyhow. Somehow being cool or avoiding conflict is better than confidently self identifying Jesus as the Lord and Savior of my life.</p>

							<p>Being holy is "boring." Being holy is "being nice." Being holy means that I can't let people know I like alcohol." Being holy means I have to watch my language, because if I say something that puts people off, they will judge me" That's the fine print I hear when people talk about when they exhibit the Holy Zone Model of living.</p>

							<p>So I'm going to say it now. I like to drink [alcohol]. I like secular music. I may not curse, but I say some things that may not be "innocent." whatever that means. I am not the greatest example of a "nice person". I will choose to skip out on a day and a half of retreat because I want to watch my favorite football team come to town, and have no regrets about it. I like things of this world. And I believe God made or allowed the creation of many of these things for me and you to enjoy. But at the end of the day, I want all of it in moderation. Because nothing the world has to offer is worth consuming my life for, and that's coming from a place of having been there.</p>

							<p>So I propose a different way of living. "The Wholly Model." There are so many words I could use instead of "wholly," but I chose not to because I didn't want this to be a Christian buzzword. I just want it to be truth. And that's where my video at the beginning of this post comes into importance.</p>

							<p>I find it interesting that at JYP Entertainment, potential celebrities are not told to be someone they are not. He doesn't say you CAN'T use foul language, be a rude person, or that you can't be prideful. He says that the kind of celebrities he wants representing the company are people who embody that kind of character. The difference between telling someone what they can't be and what they should be is can't is a permission based action, and shouldn't is a suggestion. You CAN be a rude celebrity who people don't like as a person, but you probably SHOULD not be.</p>

							<p>Seeing that lecture on television dawned on me that maybe, this man JYP who has plenty of reason to leverage his success, fame, fortune, and talent as a means of "look at me and how I am better than you as a person," actively chooses not to, and encourages others to do the same. His most compelling statement is, "[욕] 안 썼으면 좋겠어. 스타가 돼기 위해서 가 아니라, 그냥 좋은 사람을 돼기 위에서" (I hope that you would  not [swear]. Not just to become a star, but for the sake of becoming a better person). That, I believe is a prime example of a wholly model of living. See JYP describes behavior like cursing as not something you should be watchful of, but as becoming someone who does not even need to be careful of curse words.</p>

							<p>Don't separate your Christian life from your "secular" life. Let your entire life be one and the same. Because God isn't in control just when you are at Church, or with your Christian friends, or when you outreach, or at small group. God is in control of your entire life. So put Him there all the time. Maybe giving up that control means you need to change some of your past behaviors, or relinquish certain hobbies and activities because it is not something that is pleasing before God, but if you truly feel that God is at the center of it all, then there's no reason to believe that you are being a "boring" person.</p>

							<p>In Luke 11:39-40 Jesus states the following -> "And the Lord said to him, 'Now you Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and of the dish, but inside you are full of greed and wickedness. You fools! Did not he who made the outside make the inside also?'"
							The Holy Zone Model says that if I keep the outside of my cup clean, then at least I will look good or maintain some favor to God's Laws, but The Wholly Model says, if any part is unclean, we are unclean. Maybe it's time we cleaned up more than the appearance of our cups.</p>

							<p>Walking out a discipline of faith is like going to the bathroom. You need to do it everyday, and probably do so more than once a day.</p>
							<hr />

							<p>Sometimes it hurts to poop. Other times it comes out really easily. And sometimes, as hard as you try to hold it in, you can feel the pressure of it wanting to come out as you hold back. Regardless of how, when, where, and the situation, there is always a need for you to excrete waste.</p>

							<p>God will show up regardless of you. Even if you don't want Him to, he will say that it is time. But instead of resisting, what if we just let it happen? What if we chose to release the grip we have on the floodgates of heaven, and let God be the one that overflows?</p>

							<p>Now I'm not saying prayer, reading the Word, and living our our faith is the same as poop. It is obviously much much greater than our excrement. However, held in, not poured out, and left within ourselves alone, it is wasted. It BECOMES waste it because we hold onto it instead of sharing it's wealth with others, which is a shame, because the blessings of God are infinitely renewed every morning....so why hold onto something that will be filled again by Him?</p>

							<p>To end this, I want to leave an unfinished thought, that hopefully you can take and digest for yourself: What goes in matters. What you consume, how much you consume, and even when you consume. Because the things you eat are a good indicator of what is going to come out the other end.</p>

							<h2>[2016/11/13]Death before ...</h2>
							<p>I really didn't want this post to be about the election. With so much material already out there (your friends blogs, their facebook posts, people's election testimonies), I don't want this to be "just another election 2016" related post. I will make just one directly political statement. No influence based on anyone else's opinions, just my opinion, my action statement, and what I say to you: No matter the results, what really matters now is talking about what we will do now, not what happened.</p>

							<p>The following are 3 little "mini-items" sort of like a "This American Life" style post with 3 little ones put together. Each one is a different story, context, and setting. But at the end of it, we can see the same lesson.</p>

							<hr />

							
							<p><b><br>#1</br></b>One of the things that makes up the image of coffee is that it has this thing called caffeine in it. That stuff that stimulates you and gets you awake when you need a kick starter. One of the things in specialty coffee that are like curse words is the word decaffeinated. Decaffeinated coffee is one of this subjects that if you say you like, you get looked at as if you have committed a cardinal sin. Similarly portrayed in the following shirt design that I saw being sold at a shirt stand.</p>
							<p><img class="alignnone  wp-image-100" src="https://faithmatics.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/decaf.jpg" alt="decaf" width="467" height="467" /></p>

							<p>But the thing about caffeine is that as much as it draws people towards coffee, it's also one of the things that deter people from coffee. Eomen are recommended to stay away from caffeine while pregnant. Some people are hit by caffeine really hard so they tend to avoid it when possible because they do not like it's effects. Some people just don't want caffeine. There can be a number of reasons why people avoid caffeinated coffee, but still would like to drink coffee. However, in a good part of the world of specialty coffee, people ignore that demographic of people. And look at them a certain way because they are "decaf people." But without knowing what their preferences are, their situations, and their choices, you make a judgement call on someone without actually knowing them. One of my favorite podcasts currently summarizes this perfectly from the cafe setting in the audio below (12:20 - 13:40).</p>
							<p><a href="http://thecoffeepodcast.libsyn.com/e58-death-before-death-before-decaf">Listen here</a></p>
							
							<p><b><br>#2</br></b>It's very universal that at this point in our modern society, it is not the most universally acceptable thing to be a Christian. The following is a real conversation that I saw on my Facebook feed. From real people not just some conversation I found on the internet. I censored the identity of the people in these conversations.
							<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-99" src="https://faithmatics.files.wordpress.com/2016/11/sdf.png" alt="sdf" width="446" height="674" /></p>
							<p>I actually find it really commendable that person 1 (the person I actually know personally in this situation) is open to talking with Christians despite the fact that he is not Christian himself. Although he does not necessarily have faith in God, he does not easily condemn those who do, as opposed to person B who has a preconceived notion of Christians and their beliefs. Sadly, the image of God that he had is not the same as the image of God that we share as believers. Two people. Similar opinions about God, but two completely different attitudes about how they would approach conversations with people of faith.</p>
							
							<p><b><br>#3</br></b>Even the people with what looks like supposedly the hardest of hearts can have a conversation with someone they disagree with. Most recently, there was the US presidential election and the president elect now is Donald Trump. Many maybe yourself included are not happy with this result. But my third story isn't about what I think of his character, it's just an event that happened and I am here to deliver it with my own message.</p>
							<p>One of the things that Trump vowed during his campaigning was completely reversing the work that current President Obama has done with universal health care. Many news outlets have recently started covering that Trump was backpedaling on some of his initial comments on universal health care. You can read some of the content from a WSJ article, but I have referenced the quote that I think is most telling, "On health care, Mr. Trump said a big reason for his shift from his call for an all-out repeal was the meeting at the White House with Mr. Obama, who, he said, suggested areas of the Affordable Care Act, widely known as Obamacare, to preserve. “I told him I will look at his suggestions, and out of respect, I will do that,” Mr. Trump said in his Trump Tower office." [WSJ].</p>
							<p>See if you have been following the election closely, up until now getting rid of the current universal health care (or Obamacare) was one of his high priority items. Trump, who during his campaign had never budged on wanting to keep any part of Obamacare, has listened. Now he may come to decide that he wants to repeal Obamacare entirely during presidency, but what I want to hone in on is that he is listening. This the first time that he has done that publicly. Made a statement on his willingness to listen. And regardless of what you think about President-elect Trump, maybe he as well, has decided to listen.</p>
							<p><a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trump-willing-to-keep-parts-of-health-law-1478895339" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Read article here</a></p>

							<p>So why did I handpick these several different stories? Because the interactions I've seen lately, whether on social media, in conversations with people, or even from myself have been examples of this. A closed mentality. A ear that hears but does not listen. Eyes that see but do not discern. Maybe it's time we open up our hearts again. To Jesus, to our circumstances, to people.</p>

							<p>Challenge: Have a human conversation with someone. Know who they are, what their thoughts are, and why they think what they think. But most of all: listen. Listen very closely. And come to understand why they think that way. And respect them, rather than try to force change on them. Because only then will we be able to make an impact in the world.</p>

							<h2>[2016/11/4]Contagious beyond measure</h2>
							<p>This week I was in Chicago for work. At first, I wasn't sure why exactly I was being sent there. All the work that I ended up doing in Chicago was work that I could have done in Atlanta. But I can also see why people get sent to Chicago because of the time they are able to spend with their team members on a given project. But this isn't about my work in Chicago. This is about what was happening outside of work in Chicago.</p>

							<hr />

							<p>A lot of things in life are contagious. Diseases are contagious - lots of my co-workers and friends I met up with this past were sick. Laughter is contagious. Trendy music and style is contagious. Happiness is contagious. And this week, sports was contagious.</p>

							<p>For those who are not aware, the last time the Cubs won the world series was 1908. That's 108 years since their last title. The loveable losers people called them. The longest standing curse or baseball. And this year that curse was broken on Nov 2nd, as the cubs won one of the best game 7 world series in dramatic fashion against the Indians who at one point were up 3-1 in the series.</p>

							<p>Wednesday night, sitting in the lobby bar of my hotel, surrounded by so many people. My Cubs-fan bartender working while watching the game, some Chicago natives, others like me in Chicago for work, and one vocal Indians fan. I became a Cubs fan. I had to. There was just no other possible option at the time. Now of course afterwards, I was not one to pretend like I related to everyone else's victory. But within the duration of the game, I like everyone else around me was rooting for the cubs to make their comeback story. To win against odds and break the curse that had been haunting their baseball loving city for years and years. It's contagious. But the thing about sports contagiousness is that everything about it is contagious. The anger at a error or missed pitch, the stress of wondering if your team might lose, the frustration of the loss of a commanding lead, the joy and cheer at a run, even the clapping for something as simple as a walk onto first base. Everything about it is contagious.</p>

							<p>And I loved it. As an avid supporter of my football team the Seattle Seahawks, I knew a little of what they felt. 2 and a half years ago, my team had finally won our first Super Bowl in franchise history. And when you're a fan, the world feels right when you finally see your team win. No one can take away the moment. That feeling of victory is contagious. Everyone wants to join in. Hours on hours of cars honking on the streets, people hugging and high fiving strangers they met 3 hours ago. And an older man kissing his wife, then looking at me says, I'll kiss you too [which he did].</p>

							<p>It was history. And I'm thankful to say I got to experience it. Even as a bystander, I just wanted to enjoy the game. And that's exactly what I did from start to finish. However, at the end of the day, we can still measure the will a city. Whether by its population, or the number of years it waited, or by the number of days of partying, the number of people who show up to the victory parade (recorded as the 7th largest gathering of people in human history), we are able to measure tthe excitement, the joy, the contagiousness of a city. But not God.</p>

							<p>And my final thought was, "Man. What if the attitude that we have about God were to be as contagious as the attitude these people have for their baseball team?" I know super generic. But that thought couldn't leave my mind. We get a glimpse of it at places and settings like retreat, prayer vigil, and sometimes even at Sunday service, but what if every waking moment of our lives, we lived with the enthusiasm that God is alive. The Cubs found victory over a 108 year drought, but guess what, Christ won over an eternity of drought. We have every reason every day to be contagious for the Lord. And so my challenge at this time is to be contagious for the Lord, like how contagious a city became for its iconic sports team. To be contagious for eternity with God. To be contagious beyond measure.</p>

							<h2>[2016/10/17]Sermon on the mound</h2>
							<p>So as much as I like sports, I'm not really a fan of baseball. But when the post-season comes around, I usually come around to watching it, and see which teams are in the race to going to the World Series.</p>

							<p>Every baseball team has a multiple pitchers. And when someone is tired, or maybe they are having a really bad game, usually their coach will come and talk to them. To be honest, I'm completely uncertain of what they would possibly discuss on the pitchers mound, but when they are done, one of two things happen. Either the pitcher on the mound stays there, or gets switched out with another pitcher to relieve him of his pitching duties for that day.</p>

							<p>Anyone who has watched a game of baseball knows that there is this space for both teams to have their players be sitting, waiting for their turn to go up to bat (the dugout). But pitchers get their own place to get ready. This is the place where they are. They don't really sit with the other players in the dugout, because they have to always be ready. At any point in the game, they can be called on the game to start playing.</p>

							<hr />

							<p>Recently I have been reading a book on Systematic Theology with a good friend of mine. We try to read and then talk about 2 chapters a month.
							Currently we are looking at the doctrine of the Word, and looked recently at studying Inerrancy of Scripture and Clarity of Scripture.</p>

							<p>One question that was brought up within our discussion was, "What level of Scriptural literacy should we expect of the congregation?"
							This really got me thinking. Because there are so many varying levels of Scriptural literacy across churches. Some are borderline scholars, with vast knowledge of facts, dates, time periods, and having the ability to cite any and every book that they have read. Others don't take much time to read their Bible regularly, and take most of their knowledge from sermons and words given to them by peers.</p>

							<p>My thoughts? I think whether you are a church staff, a long standing member, or even a new member of a church, I believe that all are capable of preaching the Word of God.</p>

							<p>Where do I get this? Well in 1 Timothy 4, Paul addresses to Timothy in verses 6-16 the means of being a good servant. Paul says to Timothy to train. Train in goodness, in Scripture, in his faith, in being pure. And Paul didn't say to just practice these things, but also to do so publicly (v. 13). Yes Timothy was doing this in response to a time where there was historically a lot of heretical teaching around him, BUT I believe that in a way, we are all called just as much called to battle against similar enemies in our daily lives. The world around us is moving closer and closer to misconceived notions about the character of God, and for us to be able to battle against these enemies, we should be armed in faith, practice, and Scripture.</p>

							<p>In 1 Peter 3:15, Peter says, "but in your hearts honor Christ the Lord as holy, always being prepared to make a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason for the hope that is in you; yet do it with gentleness and respect" A call that any point, we should be ready to make a defense for our faith, for our belief, and for our walk. And I believe that the best place to practice this art is within the church.</p>

							<p>This is my opinion on the knowing if a congregation has a healthy balance in studying the Word: At any point in time, potentially anyone in the congregation can have something to preach that can bless the church.</p>

							<p>Realistically speaking, this would probably not happen during Sunday service. But I think that's okay, because even if it doesn't, there are plenty of opportunities to share the Gospel within the church on other levels. Small group, prayer meetings, corporate gathering, community events are all opportunities that within the church where you can practice preaching the Word of God. And if you're wrong about something, people can lovingly correct you, so that you can know that whenever it's time to share the Gospel with a non-believer, you know the right thing.</p>

							<p>If we are neck deep in the Word daily, often, consistently, then I believe there is no way that you can't bless someone with what you have been studying. Without the scholarly knowledge that individuals with experience in seminary you might be limited in what you can deliver, but nothing about the Word of the Lord says that you have nothing to offer.</p>

							<p>I bet some of you read the title of this post and thought, "Hey you spelled that wrong. It's the Sermon on the Mount." Don't worry, it's on purpose. You know that little pile dirt that baseball pitchers stand on? That's called the mound. And so my charge today is to always be ready to preach the Gospel, no matter where you are. Because you never know when you're gonna be called to the pitcher's mound.</p>

							<h2>[2016/10/14]Jesus is great, but that don't mean you ain't</h2>
							<p>Disclaimer: I feel the need to say that this post is geared towards Christians who have been in the faith, and might be having a hard time with their daily walk.</p>

							<p>I love football. I love watching football, talking about football, and hearing others talk about football. Lately, there has been one show I listen to a lot of, which is called Undisputed on Fox, hosted by Shannon Sharpe and Skip Bayless. And one segment of Undisputed that really caught me, and give me inspiration not just as a Christian, but as a person living life.</p>

							<p>One issue that is currently being discussed amongst them is about the attitude of certain football players, who are, by physical standard, great. They have the skills, potential, athleticism, and ability to exude greatness. But they aren't considered great because of their attitude. That's the short version, because I don't want to bore you with all the details. If you really want to hear the best part, watch the video linked in references with the following timestamp: (5:30 - 6:50).</p>

							<p>For those who aren't interested in watching the video, here is the quote that I thought was most impact, while still being concise:
							"You can't be great just by showing up on Sundays. It's the little things Monday through Saturday that show greatness on the field on Sunday." - Shannon Sharpe</p>

							<hr />

							<p>Today, I want to talk about greatness. But I don't want to just talk about greatness, I want to inspire the action of greatness. Everyone has the desire to be great. That is infallible fact of life. Even the laziest people I know have a desire to be great at something. Maybe some are more driven to be the best, or to prove their sense of greatness, but no matter what level of desire to have for greatness, everyone has an innate desire to be great at something.</p>

							<p>For sports, to receive the right of passage into greatness is to enter the hall of fame. No one can deny your greatness when the league/association/sport has acknowledged that you are worthy of entering the hall of fame, whether it's for football, basketball, etc. And the equivalent to that in Christianity is to be in heaven.</p>

							<p>When I ask you who you think of in your life for examples of people who show great faith, and then think about what do they do? Where do they show up? And especially, how do they show up?</p>

							<p>For me, brothers and sisters of great faith share a couple of different qualities. They prayed regularly and often. They read their Bible with resolve. They cited Scripture as the source and guide of actions in their life. They showed compassion towards others, because that's what Jesus, the author of our faith showed. They did what others couldn't, or didn't want to do. And if you agree with me and believe that these are the qualities of a faithful steward, then you as well should do the same.</p>

							<p>But to reach that pinnacle, that peak of greatness, you have to do the time. That means training every single day. Athletes work out their bodies on a daily basis. They show up to practice. They have team meetings. They go through film to know what game plan their opposition is going to come with on game day. And you should be doing the same in your faith. Doing your quiet times, having a consistent and scheduled prayer life, soaking in the Living Word, and being involved in your local church are all the same ways of being part of the “team” that is the Church.</p>

							<p>Now before you question what I've said with, "Well now that sounds legalistic. I don't live in works righteousness model of faith" Let me counter back to you and say no it's not. It's simply obedience (Deuteronomy 11:13). God has bestowed us with the ability to do great things. Let me put it in Scriptural context.</p>

							<p>Matthew 25 is all about greatness in faith. In verses 14-30, we have the parable of the servants who were given 5, 3, and 1 talent [which some scholars have deduced to be $1.25 million per talent. That’s a lot of money per person to be entrusted with!] respectively, and after some time, the master comes to collect his due, and the first two servants who had the greater amount doubled what they were given to start, while the last servant did nothing with the talent that was given to him. The master, in his disappointment punished him for his laziness. I believe, that if the servant had dealt with the masters money, but lost it, and admitted his loss would have been forgiven, not because of his ability, but because of his willingness to obey what his master had commanded. Although we are unaware the length of time that the master was gone, if I had to take a guess, the servants who invest the masters money and made more with it, worked their tail off every day to bring up that money to be the amount it was upon the masters return.</p>

							<p>See, great faith is not something you cultivate by showing up on Sunday and doing your due diligence. Great faith is cultivated every day. When you get up for your quiet time. When you meditate on the law of the Lord day and night (Psalm 1). When you take your 5 talents and turn it into 10. Great faith has a way of working itself out every single day.</p>

							<p>Coming back to the quote that I referenced from Shannon Sharpe, in the NFL, game time is Sunday. Or Thursday/Monday. Game time is the wildcard game. Game time is the NFC/AFC championship game. Game time is the Super Bowl. The chance to come up big, put up numbers and stats, and prove ourselves. The only times everyone is watching. Sometimes we treat Sunday service, retreat, Christian conferences, and in some cases, even weekly prayer meetings as our game day Sunday. The moment where we “show up.” But let me tell you, greatness [HINT HINT Jesus HINT HINT] didn’t show up only on Sunday. Greatness showed up Monday through Saturday. Greatness showed up, the moment you made the resolve to chase after greatness. So don’t wait for greatness to show up on Sunday. Show up for greatness every day. Because Jesus is great. But just because He is great, doesn’t mean you ain’t.</p>

							<h2>[2016/10/3]It's all about the joe</h2>
							<p>A little thought that I had 2 weeks ago. I wish I could polish it out more, but this was the best I could get.
							Let's say I served you a cup of coffee.</p>

							<p>Now imagine that the cup is filled with coffee. The aromatics are good. The color is deep. And the taste, it like nothing you've ever known. A coffee that fills your palate with insurmountable joy with every sip you take.</p>

							<p>But the coffee I served to you came in a styrofoam cup. Like. Imagine being served coffee in this:</p>
							<img class="alignnone  wp-image-52" src="https://faithmatics.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/cup.jpg" alt="cup" width="298" height="407" />
							<p>You didn't ask for it to be in a styrofoam cup. You're not going somewhere. You're just here to drink the coffee. The person next to you, who is also here to drink coffee, has been served as well. But the cup he/she has is not the same as your cup. Their cup is made of ceramic, it has a nice design on it, and looks like the kind of cup that you would take your "hipster photo" that you want to upload onto instagram for the likes. Would that make you feel differently about your cup of coffee? And why?</p>

							<hr />

							<p>In the mind of a consumer, it would be offensive to be served in a cup that was "below" the cut of another cup served to someone else within the same shop. But the coffee in both your paper cup, and the coffee in the other persons ceramic cup are the same.

							<p>I would like you as the reader to really sit down and think about that concept. The cups are different, but the coffee, the content, what is being held in each of your cups, is the same before continuing on in this post.</p>

							<p>It is not our outward appearance that determines our identity, or our circumstances that affect our being. But really, our contents, the things we hold, and what we have within ourselves that define our being. We are, by function, the vessels for the substance that is Christ.</p>

							<p>Cups have no bearing on how coffee will taste, and with Jesus, we are the same way. As vessels for His glory, we are only containers for His ultimate blessing. Coffee takes the shape, size, volume, and form of it's container. The only thing cups have to be worried about is making sure it can hold the contents.</p>

							<p>Often we worry about our size, shape, appearance, material, our jobs, our money, grades, hobbies, lifestyle, and other factors to determine who we are or what we're worth, but that's not how God feels about us.</p>

							<p>Ephesians 2:1-10 are the verses that I think paint one of the most beautiful pictures of the fullness of God that has been bestowed upon each and every single one of us, but also keeping the integrity of the statement that each and every single one of us are made unique in the hands of the great creator. (will put the verses in references if you want to easily access them)</p>

							<p>Note in verse 10 that Paul defines us as God's workmanship, and that we were all created in Christ Jesus for good works. That God already made us how He wanted us to be fitted in. That is something amazing. If you want to know why and how that's possible, see in verses 4-9, that our faith, not our works define our identity. Rather, our works showcase the grace of God.</p>

							<p>Your life, regardless of its circumstances, holds a meaning and specific purpose for the glory of God. Things won't always work or look exactly like what you wanted them to, or get the results you wanted to see. But that's okay, because your cup isn't what it's all about. It's all about the joe.</p>

							<p><strong>References:</strong>
							Ephesians 2: 1-10
							And you were dead in the trespasses and sins in which you once walked, following the course of this world, following the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience— among whom we all once lived in the passions of our flesh, carrying out the desires of the body and the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, like the rest of mankind. But God, being rich in mercy, because of the great love with which he loved us, even when we were dead in our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ—by grace you have been saved— and raised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, so that in the coming ages he might show the immeasurable riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus. For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast. For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them.</p>

							<h2>[2016/9/26]Church is like...</h2>
							<p>This is a post for my blog that is absolutely later than it should have started. But here it is. Faithmatics. What does that mean? And why is it named that? Well I wanted a clever name. And as a man of faith, I wanted this at its roots to be about Jesus. But in my pursuit of making coffee a regular hobby for myself, I also wanted this space to be open for my hobby. In coffee there is an aspect of the coffee called aromatics. The smell and stimulation of the beans. I hope that this content is stimulating for you as a reader. But I also hope that it is a space full of truth in the Word, as the -ic in aromatic means 'of or pertaining to'. And that's why this blog is named what it is.</p>
							<p>So for my first content, I'd like to start with the concluding statement. Church is like a coffee shop. What does that statement mean? What does it entail? And why? But hear me out. My inspiration came from a coffee podcast, where they said that coffee shops are people focused, and it's language is coffee. What if we made out church to be people focused, and the language we spoke through was Jesus. Because that's what a church is about in the end. Jesus. Coffee shops like churches have programs. They have hours of service. They have people serving, and they have places to sit and loiter. And all of this culminates into one thing and that is community.</p>

							<p>Coffee shops are community, just like how churches are community. And there are many levels of participation from its guests. Some are coffee connoisseurs themselves, looking to find the next cup or coffee for their enjoyment. Others just want to use the shop for a good space to study in, and others just want to make a quick trip in and a quick trip out as they continue on in their busy day. But whether you're there for a quick drink, or are going to be there for hours on end, there is one thing that is shared between all those people. The time you get with a consumer as a barista is available from the moment they enter until the moment they leave. You are largely responsible for the experience they receive from them walking into the door, to them ordering, or asking questions, for them receiving their cup of coffee, to greeting them as they walk out the door. Sometimes you can't help their experience get better. Maybe they just ordered the wrong drink, maybe they have had a bad day, which affected how they felt about the overall experience at your shop, but maybe, just maybe, they felt dissatisfied by the kind of service that they were given by you.</p>

							<p>You forgot to say have a nice day, or seemed annoyed that they had so many questions to ask you. Or the greatest transgression of all. You allowed them to have the minimum experience at your shop. Without a word, without a thought, without any more effort than just the bare minimum to serve, you gave them what they ordered, and let the opportunity to make conversation slip out the door. The opportunity to share more about coffee, or the opportunity to ask them about their day, or to wish them well, or ask them to come back again, because you would be excited to serve them. When the hospitality of a coffee shop disappears, something goes wrong with the kind of service they gave to offer.</p>

							<p>Now let's take it back to the church. There is so much opportunity to talk to someone on a Sunday, and welcome them into your community. They might be looking for a church, some just visiting because their friend forced them to come, and others might be just visiting. But just like a coffee shop, it would be a waste to just let them come in and walk out without taking hold of the opportune moment to share about Jesus with them. Share about life with life, share your story with them. Don't be the coffee shop that will just let people walk in and out without notice. Be the coffee shop that cares. The one that looks forward to the next visit from your customers.</p>

							<p>And so I'll end with a challenge statement. The goal of what I've written about. Hopefully something easy to remember. I pray you will carry it with you as you go about in your week.</p>

							<p>Church, is like a coffee shop. Its focus is people. Its language is Jesus. And we are its baristas.</p>
