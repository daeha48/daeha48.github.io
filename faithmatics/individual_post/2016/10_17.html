            <p>So as much as I like sports, I'm not really a fan of baseball. But when the post-season comes around, I usually come around to watching it, and see which teams are in the race to going to the World Series.</p>

							<p>Every baseball team has a multiple pitchers. And when someone is tired, or maybe they are having a really bad game, usually their coach will come and talk to them. To be honest, I'm completely uncertain of what they would possibly discuss on the pitchers mound, but when they are done, one of two things happen. Either the pitcher on the mound stays there, or gets switched out with another pitcher to relieve him of his pitching duties for that day.</p>

							<p>Anyone who has watched a game of baseball knows that there is this space for both teams to have their players be sitting, waiting for their turn to go up to bat (the dugout). But pitchers get their own place to get ready. This is the place where they are. They don't really sit with the other players in the dugout, because they have to always be ready. At any point in the game, they can be called on the game to start playing.</p>

							<p>Recently I have been reading a book on Systematic Theology with a good friend of mine. We try to read and then talk about 2 chapters a month.
							Currently we are looking at the doctrine of the Word, and looked recently at studying Inerrancy of Scripture and Clarity of Scripture.</p>

							<p>One question that was brought up within our discussion was, "What level of Scriptural literacy should we expect of the congregation?"
							This really got me thinking. Because there are so many varying levels of Scriptural literacy across churches. Some are borderline scholars, with vast knowledge of facts, dates, time periods, and having the ability to cite any and every book that they have read. Others don't take much time to read their Bible regularly, and take most of their knowledge from sermons and words given to them by peers.</p>

							<p>My thoughts? I think whether you are a church staff, a long standing member, or even a new member of a church, I believe that all are capable of preaching the Word of God.</p>

							<p>Where do I get this? Well in 1 Timothy 4, Paul addresses to Timothy in verses 6-16 the means of being a good servant. Paul says to Timothy to train. Train in goodness, in Scripture, in his faith, in being pure. And Paul didn't say to just practice these things, but also to do so publicly (v. 13). Yes Timothy was doing this in response to a time where there was historically a lot of heretical teaching around him, BUT I believe that in a way, we are all called just as much called to battle against similar enemies in our daily lives. The world around us is moving closer and closer to misconceived notions about the character of God, and for us to be able to battle against these enemies, we should be armed in faith, practice, and Scripture.</p>

							<p>In 1 Peter 3:15, Peter says, "but in your hearts honor Christ the Lord as holy, always being prepared to make a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason for the hope that is in you; yet do it with gentleness and respect" A call that any point, we should be ready to make a defense for our faith, for our belief, and for our walk. And I believe that the best place to practice this art is within the church.</p>

							<p>This is my opinion on the knowing if a congregation has a healthy balance in studying the Word: At any point in time, potentially anyone in the congregation can have something to preach that can bless the church.</p>

							<p>Realistically speaking, this would probably not happen during Sunday service. But I think that's okay, because even if it doesn't, there are plenty of opportunities to share the Gospel within the church on other levels. Small group, prayer meetings, corporate gathering, community events are all opportunities that within the church where you can practice preaching the Word of God. And if you're wrong about something, people can lovingly correct you, so that you can know that whenever it's time to share the Gospel with a non-believer, you know the right thing.</p>

							<p>If we are neck deep in the Word daily, often, consistently, then I believe there is no way that you can't bless someone with what you have been studying. Without the scholarly knowledge that individuals with experience in seminary you might be limited in what you can deliver, but nothing about the Word of the Lord says that you have nothing to offer.</p>

							<p>I bet some of you read the title of this post and thought, "Hey you spelled that wrong. It's the Sermon on the Mount." Don't worry, it's on purpose. You know that little pile dirt that baseball pitchers stand on? That's called the mound. And so my charge today is to always be ready to preach the Gospel, no matter where you are.Â Because you never know when you're gonna be called to the pitcher's mound.</p>
