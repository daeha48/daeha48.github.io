            <p>I imagine most of us have come across Physics in our lives, and have learned some basic concepts of Physics from our classes, or maybe our universities. Well one thing you learn when you begin to understand Physics is that without friction, we wouldn't be able to walk. In a perfect world that has no friction, the only way for objects to move would be to have an external force come and act upon an object. This would render us unable to walk because even if we tried, we would be stuck in place unable to push on the ground. However, because of friction, the force from our feet pushing against the ground and the ground pushing against our feet (but not moving because the total mass of ground beneath us being much greater than our mass), we are able to make movements forward.</p>

            <p>When I hear my peers talk about moments that they faced where someone said something ridiculous or even wrong, a lot of the time I tend to get a story that involves holding back words because they wanted to be loving. As if to be a loving person meant to refrain from any use of words that would potentially offend someone. That confrontation was something to avoid rather than embraced. I forgot, don't agree with that. I would say that there are some instances where refraining from speaking is better because it is emotionally driven, but at its core confrontation is not unloving. In fact, it can potentially be one of the most loving things that you can do for someone.</p>

            <p>I'm not trying to redefine love. I am not here to say that you don't know love. But I'd like to think that in love, to be confrontational is to be loving. Where do I get that? Jesus is confrontational.</p>

            <p>In the scene where Jesus meets the rich young ruler (Mark 10:17-31 & Matthew 19:16-25). the rich young ruler knows that he is a pretty stand up guy. He bears no irresponsible habits, doesn't swindle people of money, is a family man, and seems to have his life in order. And he asks Jesus for the answer to eternal life. But instead of being told that he has everything going for him, Jesus points out the one idol in this mans life. His riches. I'd take it a step further and even identify his status. This dude probably thought that all too well with the things that he has, he is doing everything he needs to do the way it needs to be done. That's what he wanted to hear. But that's not the answer he was given.</p>

            <p>Instead he is confronted with the one thing that he desires most to keep in the world. And that disappoints him. Because even though nothing else entices him, he still has one thing yet that he has not relinquished to the God. And needless to say, he didn't take the criticism very well. He rather walked away rather deflated by the fact that he owned great possessions and did not want to part with them (I don't think his disappointment was wrong, but I think his immediate response is very telling that he was not ready to make such a big commitment or consider it in that moment and time).</p>

            <p>We won't hear about this man again, but one thing that I wonder is after he processed this information, how did he respond? Did he eventually decide that pursuing eternal life in heaven was not worth losing his possessions over? Or did he realize that Jesus had given him wisdom worth accepting. Only the Lord knows.</p>

            <p>Confrontation is hard. It can be painful to hear, and be something that we don't want or expect from our loved ones. But I would like to think that it's loving because it makes us think. Without confrontation about our problems or issues, we wouldn't think about our shortcomings because unless we are constantly thinking, life will go on exactly the same as it has been until this point. So I willingly accept confrontation, and will openly confront those I love in wisdom. Because I hope that through it, a heart that is for the Lord will continue to sprout in my peers.</p>
