            <p>I don't play much poker. Nor do I think I am or would be very good at the game. But sometimes I do like to watch poker videos and see players play. And after watching games for a time in my life, I have noticed that maybe we could learn something from poker players/gamblers in our own lives.</p>

								<p>In poker, specifically Texas Hold 'em. Each player playing is dealt 2 cards, which are called hole cards. These cards are visible to the players individually. Then there are 3 cards flipped into the center, which all players are allowed to use to make poker hands. These three cards are called the "Flop." Another card is flipped, called the "turn," and then a fifth and final center card called the "river." From the moment you get your hole cards, you are allowed to choose whether or not you would like to continue playing the round, or if you would like to fold your hand and the opportunity to win this pot. This offer as well as the offer to bet is given consecutively at the flop, turn, and river before finally a reveal of cards of all the players to see who would win the winnings from that round.</p>

								<p>I would like to play a scenario of poker. You as the player, the Devil is the other player, and God is the dealer. And your hole: A 3 of heart and a 7 of spades. Not a promising hand. But at least there is a potential for a straight. So maybe you play it out. The flop: A 3 of diamond, King of spades, and 4 of heart. Not promising. You have a pair of threes, and still a potential for a straight. But it would be likely to fold here right? The devil looks confident. Showing no sign that he is backing down. Maybe even raising the stakes on you. Could he be bluffing? Or was he sure he had something better. </p>

								<p>But no. God, the dealer, gives you that look. The look that says play. The look that says you can keep going. Maybe even a slightly nudge to see the game to the end. So you do. The turn: a 5 of diamond. As if the straight was coming to you all along. That it was meant to be this way. So you call the devils raise. And the river comes. And. it's. An Ace of spades. Nothing. No straight. No real hands. Just a pair of 3s to show for yourself. </p>

								<p>But God tells you that look of victory. Like everything is okay. And you are just ready to give up. And internally, you are wondering to yourself why you would listen. He handed you one of the worst pairs on the entire deck, and yet you are expected to be able to play in victory.</p>

								<p>But upon playing the board and ending the round, you reveal your pair of 3s, only to find that the devil has been bluffing you the entire game. He has nothing. Just a jack and a 10. And you win with just a measly pair of 3s.</p>

								<p>Sometimes in life we find ourselves asking why God didn't make us better, stronger, smarter, more equipped. We want to play out life like we have grinding 10 levels above our trials to prove that none of it is difficult or challenging. But what if that's not Good wants. He doesn't want us to be overpowered, or to be overleveled. God doesn't need you to be a royal flush. Maybe He only needs you to be a pairnof 3s. In any given game of poker, a pair of 3s won't win every game. It won't even win most games. But when used correctly, it surely can win a game at the right time.</p>

								<p>While thinking about this analogy, one thing bothered me about it. The fact that God is the dealer. That's like cheating because God as the dealer to play out the board. But as I thought about it more, the more it made sense to me. God has to be the dealer. And the reason why is grace. Grace is the biggest cheat code in this game. Grace is the reason why we are able to experience victory. Grace is the reason why a pair of 3s can win a game. Therefore, grace is truly the greatest scandal of all. And yet, that is exactly what God desires. For us to live out our scandals proudly. So today I hope you experience victory in the scandal that is grace in your life. </p>
