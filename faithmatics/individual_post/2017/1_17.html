            <p>If you are not into hearing people talk about poop stuff then you might feel a little bit grossed out by this blog post, but I think it makes sense. Otherwise, I hope you are blessed by this short post of mine.</p>

							<p>Walking out a discipline of faith is like going to the bathroom. You need to do it everyday, and probably do so more than once a day.</p>
							<hr />

							<p>Sometimes it hurts to poop. Other times it comes out really easily. And sometimes, as hard as you try to hold it in, you can feel the pressure of it wanting to come out as you hold back. Regardless of how, when, where, and the situation, there is always a need for you to excrete waste.</p>

							<p>God will show up regardless of you. Even if you don't want Him to, he will say that it is time. But instead of resisting, what if we just let it happen? What if we chose to release the grip we have on the floodgates of heaven, and let God be the one that overflows?</p>

							<p>Now I'm not saying prayer, reading the Word, and living our our faith is the same as poop. It is obviously much much greater than our excrement. However, held in, not poured out, and left within ourselves alone, it is wasted. It BECOMES waste it because we hold onto it instead of sharing it's wealth with others, which is a shame, because the blessings of God are infinitely renewed every morning....so why hold onto something that will be filled again by Him?</p>

							<p>To end this, I want to leave an unfinished thought, that hopefully you can take and digest for yourself: What goes in matters. What you consume, how much you consume, and even when you consume. Because the things you eat are a good indicator of what is going to come out the other end.</p>
