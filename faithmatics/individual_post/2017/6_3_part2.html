            <p>Some of you who actually follow my blog might be asking why I moved from hosting on Wordpress to just having my own website.</p>

								<p>All in all, I don't really have any good reasons. Wordpress is actually fine. It can embed images, easily link my blog pages (which currently I can't do yet, but hey, work in progress right?), and it works, while my website......well kind of doesn't.</p>

								<p>But having a functional website isn't what I'm exactly going for right now. I just want a great place to present the work that I'm doing, and I realized that to publicly showcase my work would require me to make more and more domains that I don't necessarily want. So I decided, instead of having several websites to talk do my blog, personal code projects, interests, hobbies, and other things, I'd make my own playground. And github.io is the best place to do it. Free, public (because it's not like I care if anyone can see my source code), and easy to access from any of my computers through source coding. So this is the route I am taking. If you just want to see my blog, that's fine! I'll try not to push any of my other projects onto this one. But if you want to see what else I do that isn't blogging, you can see it here. Hope you enjoy.</p>
								
								<p><b>Note:</b> Because even this website is a project I'm working on, at times things might change, until I get down to a format I am comfortable with. So sometimes it might even be broken!</p>
								
								<p>Regards, <br>Mark</br></p>
