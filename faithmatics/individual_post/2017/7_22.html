    <p class="w3-opacity"><i>2017/7/22</i></p>
    <p class="w3-justify"> 
            <p>Traveling for work can be a bit of a hassle. Yeah the free miles on my airline accounts are nice, and yes I can eat food that I otherwise would not be able to or want to go out for because things get expensed, but that doesn't really outweigh what I think really makes it inconvenient at times. The novelty of traveling for work is actually pretty short term in the grand scheme of things. When it happens consistently twice a month, and takes up 2-3.5 days of your week, you start to really realize how much time you lose. </p>

								<p>Working at a suburb that is a 30 minute drive out of Chicago (with no direct public transit to the city) makes you think about all the things you could have been doing (or not doing) at home.</p>
								<p>The extra hours you spend working, "since you're here" where your other team members might be seems more like a sign that they just want to watch over your work more than think the excuse that the team being in the same place is good for productivity.</p>
								<p>At the very least, I would like to keep work as a secondary conversation outside of work. Work life, or work-place related stories are okay, because sometimes they're more about the social content than "work." But work conversations, I am tired of. The thing I would most want to do when not at work is not talk about the work that I am or have to start working on soon. As if instead of relaxing when not working, I am forced to preview what I will do tomorrow because I need to hear it more than once a day.</p>

								<p>At some point, I've always heard this when bringing out the problems of work to people. That vacation or taking a break is good. But is it really? The last time I took time off for an extended weekend from work, I found myself working late hours right before my time off, because I was still "expected to deliver work due at the end of the week" even though I was given the task on Monday. And was forced to travel the week of my weekend vacation, and the subsequent week after my vacation. I went 10 days sleeping in my own bed only 1 night while riding 6 different flights. I was more tired after everything was over because I took time off. The only thing that made my vacation worth the journey was seeing 트와이스 (Twice) in person.</p>

								<p>Temporary thrills and escapes are meaningless to me when the actual daily state of my mind is hindered by the work around me. And although the people at my work (in Atlanta, not my team in Chicago) are individuals that I can enjoy working around, the actual work itself is draining. But how does one reconcile these problems? These are the answers that I have not, but hopefully seek to find as I adjust to the lifestyle that is work. </p>

								<p>Situationally things suck, and it's hard to respond with anything better than "fine" or "alright" when someone asks how I am doing, when it might exactly be either of those things internally. But I'm not discouraged. There's still a bigger picture in front of me.</p>

								<p>Work life isn't a race. It's a long, hike. It has all these different paths, but no indicator which is best. But there are no mile markers;. At some points it's steep, while at other points is mild and easily traverse-able. You don't really know when it ends. Maybe it doesn't. Some choose to turn around and go back down the way they came and choose a different route. But does a different route promise an easier path? Will it even help you reach the top? Is it a risk worth taking, or do we commit to the path we have already taken. These are all the questions we ask as we walk this road, and at times it feels pointless. But I have one hope that at least for now, it keeps me moving and keeps me sane. If I make my choices without regret, looking behind me at what "should have been," "could have been," and look forward to what "can be," and "what yet still I can do," then I see a lot more doors that are still open versus the ones that are closed. We can't change yesterday, but we can change tomorrow, and still have control of today. So at least for now, my situation sucks, but my prospects are still good. </p>
