            <p>Originally I had a post with all of the things I had put down for travel tips....And somehow, those files disappeared. Both my online and offline copies of my post that I wanted to do related to travel are gone. And I'm pretty sad. Alas, I refuse to let that stop me from posting my thoughts about travel. But here is 2018. </p>
            
            <p>As someone who thinks maybe way too much about the "perfection" of my analogies, and whether my blog posts will be any good, I have a lot of trouble coming up with something to add to my blog, and being happy with it. I have all these ideas of things I want to say and do, but lately it has become really hard to actually sit down and do them. I know I'm really bad at doing work at home. Maybe it really is time to just, commit to working at a cafe when I am able to do so and really get down to business. Or to really set some concrete goals. But regardless, one of the things that I want to accomplish in 2018 is being able to add more features, more content, and do more projects within my little sandbox space. So expect me to make more posts, and even talk about my travel tips, as well as see actual posts show up in the travel portion of my website! Hopefully along the way I can find better ways to format it so that it becomes better to look at. Fingers crossed to 2018!</p>
