            <p>So I started getting into photography recently. And when I get into something, I really like to get into it. Looking at reviews, what people say about cameras, lenses, quality, discussions, sensor systems, compromises, etc etc I've consumed quite a bit of information about cameras. </p>
            
            <p>One of the things that I realized in photography is that the choices we make in "gear" comes down to what we can afford, but that doesn't stop us from lusting for the best. Looking over at what professional photographers identify as the top of the line. Sometimes we even stretch ourselves to get the best, and then realize something lacking. We want more. The prestige can be quite overwhelming. Now watch the following video:</p>

            <p>Oobah Butler manages to accomplish something visibly real, but in reality completely fake. A shell of the truth. He makes a fake restaurant, and manages to get the internet so raving mad about it, that progressively it becomes the #1 recommended restaurant on TripAdvisor (With the help of some acting and a lot of lying of course). But how?</p>
            <p>Through the social networking society has become so reliant on. Without even realizing it, we have become a world where instead of establishing individual log books, we seek out the known, tested, trialed, and sustained businesses. No one wants to walk into an unknown restaurant, and come out feeling robbed of our time/money/effort. But we do want to go to a well reviewed, 4.7 star, $$ sign restaurant that is listed in the top 50 places to eat in blahblahblah city. Because at least we know, it's been done before. I "saw it on Instagram, and it looked so good. I need to get there."</p>
            
            <p>See our social bias and belief that if someone else, or some 359 someone elses, said "Yes that's good" then we would have little doubt of disappointment. And when we do get let down, it's definitely not because I made the wrong choice. No it's because OTHER PEOPLE over-hyped it. It just got too popular. Too mainstream. Too public.</p>
            
            <p>My personal story. Last November 2017, I went on a trip to Japan. One of the things that I did was go to this area called Arashiyama, and my travel partners and I stumbled across a restaurant with a long line. So many Japanese people were there. Even foreigners. We asked a guy near the front if it was good, to which he responded that he didn't really know, a lot of people have been waiting for it, and it seems like it'll be good. Online reviews seemed good. People were in line for it. I wasn't convinced, but one person on my travel trip was. He was very convinced he wanted to eat here. I didn't want to wait in line, and would rather go around looking at more things nearby, but he needed to eat here. So we came back after some exploration, and sure enough, the line was virtually gone, and we went inside (it helps that we also came after the lunch rush).</p>
            
            <p>This was one of the more disappointing meals on my vacation. And yet, it was also one of the most expensive. I enjoy tofu. I like tofu. But would I go back to pay $35 for this single option course meal? No. I wouldn't. It seemed like even local Japanese people didn't realize what they were getting either, as I saw families sitting near us almost just as confused with their dishes as these Asian-American foreigners were. Needless to say I wasn't super thrilled while leaving the restaurant.
            
           However, I will say the atmosphere alone was one of the best.That salvaged some of the emotion I felt. A hard lesson that not everything looks as good as it seems on the surface.</p>
           
           <p>I'm not saying that you should swear off of Yelp, Thrillist, Eater, or any other website to discover your next food venture. Those websites provide a well intended service in wanting to present an easy list of places that would satisfy any wayward traveler. But I am saying, maybe we should take that "#10 of 7000" ranking with a grain of salt.</p>
           
           <p>So today, tomorrow, or maybe next week; sometime this year. Build your own adventure. Do something no one else has done. Gone where no one else has gone. Photograph it for the first time.......</p>
           <p>....</p>
           <p>....</p>
           <p>....</p>
           <p>....</p>
           <p>....</p>
           <p>....</p>
           <p>....</p>
           <p>....</p>
           <p>No I take that back. In fact, do what someone else has done. Don't go where no one else has gone. Shoot the same photo that shows up on Google Images first 200 results. Do what you want, because it's YOUR adventure. It's okay that it's been done a thousand times over. Do it because you wanted to. At least you did it through your own lens, instead of through another's.</p>
