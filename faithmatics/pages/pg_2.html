                <p>I really didn't want this post to be about the election. With so much material already out there (your friends blogs, their facebook posts, people's election testimonies), I don't want this to be "just another election 2016" related post. I will make just one directly political statement. No influence based on anyone else's opinions, just my opinion, my action statement, and what I say to you: No matter the results, what really matters now is talking about what we will do now, not what happened.</p>

                <p>The following are 3 little "mini-items" sort of like a "This American Life" style post with 3 little ones put together. Each one is a different story, context, and setting. But at the end of it, we can see the same lesson.</p>

                <p>This week I was in Chicago for work. At first, I wasn't sure why exactly I was being sent there. All the work that I ended up doing in Chicago was work that I could have done in Atlanta. But I can also see why people get sent to Chicago because of the time they are able to spend with their team members on a given project. But this isn't about my work in Chicago. This is about what was happening outside of work in Chicago.</p>

                <p>So as much as I like sports, I'm not really a fan of baseball. But when the post-season comes around, I usually come around to watching it, and see which teams are in the race to going to the World Series.</p>

                <p>Every baseball team has a multiple pitchers. And when someone is tired, or maybe they are having a really bad game, usually their coach will come and talk to them. To be honest, I'm completely uncertain of what they would possibly discuss on the pitchers mound, but when they are done, one of two things happen. Either the pitcher on the mound stays there, or gets switched out with another pitcher to relieve him of his pitching duties for that day.</p>

      <p>Disclaimer: I feel the need to say that this post is geared towards Christians who have been in the faith, and might be having a hard time with their daily walk.</p>

							<p>I love football. I love watching football, talking about football, and hearing others talk about football. Lately, there has been one show I listen to a lot of, which is called Undisputed on Fox, hosted by Shannon Sharpe and Skip Bayless. And one segment of Undisputed that really caught me, and give me inspiration not just as a Christian, but as a person living life.</p>

Although I'm from here, I came to love the Seattle Seahawks and football in Seattle, as strange as it may be. What do I do here? Post about my random thoughts in life. And to encourage everyone else around me thinking as well. It's also a space where I can build up my ability to develop as well. Feel free to join me on this adventure</p>
