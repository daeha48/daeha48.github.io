            <p>I like to listen to the radio on my way to work sometimes. Usually that either consists of npr, or traffic stations. And one of the things that I like about npr is that they tend to format their stories as story telling, as opposed to trying to sell you an interesting article title. One of my most recent listens that I enjoyed involved drug addiction in Portugal, and how decriminalizing drug addiction has positively affect people. I highly recommend listening to the ~4 min audio or reading the transcript before continuing further.</p>

                <p>This post was directly inspired by a shirt text that I noticed at Walmart this past Saturday. And as I crossed paths with this shirt, immediately so many thoughts came into my mind. The first being how much I disagree with the message that this shirt delivers.</p>

                <p>I imagine most of us have come across Physics in our lives, and have learned some basic concepts of Physics from our classes, or maybe our universities. Well one thing you learn when you begin to understand Physics is that without friction, we wouldn't be able to walk. In a perfect world that has no friction, the only way for objects to move would be to have an external force come and act upon an object. This would render us unable to walk because even if we tried, we would be stuck in place unable to push on the ground. However, because of friction, the force from our feet pushing against the ground and the ground pushing against our feet (but not moving because the total mass of ground beneath us being much greater than our mass), we are able to make movements forward.</p>

                <p>Atlanta was crazy about making it to the super bowl. That they were finally able to get there again since 1999. The opportunity as something finally happening.</p>

            <p>I used to listen to a lot of K-pop. I don't anymore because either time, level of interest, or I'm just picky about what I want to listen to, but I am a strong Once (follower of a girl group named Twice). The group was actually formed from a Survival show called "Sixteen," where all the girls competed with one another and other girls to get a spot into the group that would be Twice. And one of my favorite segments from that show was the following lecture given by CEO Park Jin Young. I'm sorry if you're not Korean, the links I share don't have English subs.</p>

      <p>My name is Mark, and I am a Korean-American living in Metro-Atlanta. Born in Atlanta, lived in Seoul, Seattle, and Atlanta throughout my life. Although I'm from here, I came to love the Seattle Seahawks and football in Seattle, as strange as it may be. What do I do here? Post about my random thoughts in life. And to encourage everyone else around me thinking as well. It's also a space where I can build up my ability to develop as well. Feel free to join me on this adventure</p>
