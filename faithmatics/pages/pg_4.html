        <p>So I started getting into photography recently. And when I get into something, I really like to get into it. Looking at reviews, what people say about cameras, lenses, quality, discussions, sensor systems, compromises, etc etc I've consumed quite a bit of information about cameras. </p>
            
        <p>One of the things that I realized in photography is that the choices we make in "gear" comes down to what we can afford, but that doesn't stop us from lusting for the best. Looking over at what professional photographers identify as the top of the line. Sometimes we even stretch ourselves to get the best, and then realize something lacking. We want more. The prestige can be quite overwhelming. Now watch the following video:</p>

            <p>Originally I had a post with all of the things I had put down for travel tips....And somehow, those files disappeared. Both my online and offline copies of my post that I wanted to do related to travel are gone. And I'm pretty sad. Alas, I refuse to let that stop me from posting my thoughts about travel.

            <p>Traveling for work can be a bit of a hassle. Yeah the free miles on my airline accounts are nice, and yes I can eat food that I otherwise would not be able to or want to go out for because things get expensed, but that doesn't really outweigh what I think really makes it inconvenient at times. The novelty of traveling for work is actually pretty short term in the grand scheme of things. When it happens consistently twice a month, and takes up 2-3.5 days of your week, you start to really realize how much time you lose. </p>

            <p>I don't play much poker. Nor do I think I am or would be very good at the game. But sometimes I do like to watch poker videos and see players play. And after watching games for a time in my life, I have noticed that maybe we could learn something from poker players/gamblers in our own lives.</p>
