        <p>A little thought that I had 2 weeks ago. I wish I could polish it out more, but this was the best I could get.
            Let's say I served you a cup of coffee.</p>

            <p>Now imagine that the cup is filled with coffee. The aromatics are good. The color is deep. And the taste, it like nothing you've ever known. A coffee that fills your palate with insurmountable joy with every sip you take.</p>

        <p>This is a post for my blog that is absolutely later than it should have started. But here it is. Faithmatics. What does that mean? And why is it named that? Well I wanted a clever name. And as a man of faith, I wanted this at its roots to be about Jesus. But in my pursuit of making coffee a regular hobby for myself, I also wanted this space to be open for my hobby. In coffee there is an aspect of the coffee called aromatics. The smell and stimulation of the beans. I hope that this content is stimulating for you as a reader. But I also hope that it is a space full of truth in the Word, as the -ic in aromatic means 'of or pertaining to'. And that's why this blog is named what it is.</p>

      <p>My name is Mark, and I am a Korean-American living in Metro-Atlanta. Born in Atlanta, lived in Seoul, Seattle, and Atlanta throughout my life. Although I'm from here, I came to love the Seattle Seahawks and football in Seattle, as strange as it may be. What do I do here? Post about my random thoughts in life. And to encourage everyone else around me thinking as well. It's also a space where I can build up my ability to develop as well. Feel free to join me on this adventure</p>
