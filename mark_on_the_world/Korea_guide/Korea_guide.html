    <h2 class="w3-wide">Korea: A guide to getting around Seoul</h2>

    <p class="w3-justify"> 
            <p>Seoul is one of the easier world cities to navigate, and with such a developed public transportation system, it is a good starter location for travel. That being said, it can be difficult to find your way around if you donâ€™t know where to look. So here are some useful things to do if you plan on visiting Korea.</p>

            <p><b>Disclaimer:</b> This guide is a bit of a "public beta."(?) There's a few things that I actually haven't tried, but read about, so I'll try to be transparent with things that I don't have much background in throughout. I expect to make a lot of updates in May/June 2018 after I go to Korea.</p>
