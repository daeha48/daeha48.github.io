            <p>The first encounter you are likely to have with public transportation in Korea is probably getting from the airport to where you plan on staying. And I’m here to tell you there’s a good chance you can get from Incheon airport to just about anywhere in the city. Like any city, taxi prices rack up really quickly, so avoid at all costs if you are trying to keep a budget friendly trip.</p>
            <p>Since January 2018, there has been a new addition of the Terminal 2 at Incheon Airport. So if you have not been to Korea, or it has been a while since you’ve been in Korea, you might find yourself in a new and unfamiliar environment upon arrival.</p>
            <a name="term_map"><big><b><p>Terminal map reference:</p></b></big></a>
            <p>I plan on referencing these maps for what zones to look for, but your own sake, knowing the general layout of these maps is pretty good. One thing that is deceptive about these maps is that they don’t identify outside vs. inside. Once you leave through the numbered arrows, you are outside breathing 100% Korean air.</p>

            <a name="airport_seoul"><big><b><p>Airport to Seoul via bus</p></b></big></a>
            <p>Buses can range between 10000 and 16000 depending on where you are going and which one you want to take. Which one is best for you kind of depends on where you are going, how much time you are willing to spend traveling, and cost. A standard bus might bring you right in front of your stay if you plan it right. Any of the buses will take between an hour and an hour and a half depending on traffic and how many stops you take. So get comfortable.</p>
            <p>Ticket boxes are designated in the terminal maps, so keep a note of where they are for your arrival into Seoul.</p>
            <p>So here are a couple of the bus options (Not listing all of them, but a few major ones that I assume would likely get used):</p>

            <a name="hongdae"><b><p>To Hongdae</p></b></a>
            <p>6002 Bus – 12000 KRW</p>
            <p><a href="#term_map">Terminal map</a>: If you are leaving from Terminal 1, look for exit 5 on the 1F. If you are leaving from Terminal 2, look for No. 30 on the “Traffic center basement”</p>

          <img src="../../images/Korea_transpo_guide/6002.PNG" class="w3-round w3-margin-bottom" alt="Random Name" style="width:100%">
        </div>
            <a name="coex_jamsil"><b><p>To COEX or Jamsil</p></b></a>
            <p>6006 or 6103 – 15000 KRW</p>
            <p><a href="#term_map">Terminal map</a>: If you are leaving from Terminal 1, look for exit 4 for 6006 and exit 7 for 6103 on the 1F. If you are leaving from Terminal 2, look for No. 14 for 6006 and No. 22 for 6103 on the “Traffic center basement”</p>
            <p>From personal experience, I have taken the 6103, and it’s a pretty good option for anyone staying near COEX. It also drops you off in front of the City Air Terminal, which is a great resource for checking into your flight which I’ll talk about later. But if you are going to the Jamsil area, take 6006</p>
            <p>6006</p>
            <!-- Bus 6006-->

            <a name="myeongdong"><b><p>To Myeongdong</p></b></a>
            <p>In this case, unless the 6015 bus is stopping you right in front of where you are staying, you might as well take the 6001 bus</p>
            <p><a href="#term_map">Terminal map</a>: If you are leaving from Terminal 1, look for exit 5 for both on the 1F. If you are leaving from Terminal 2, look for No. 29 for 6001 and No. 28 for 6015 on the “Traffic center basement”</p>

            <p>Wow, so many buses, and this isn’t even half from the list! All this to say, there’s a lot of options, and the right bus will probably take you anywhere within Seoul.</p>
            <p>If an area you are going to isn’t on this list, you can check out some of the resources I used at the bottom of the page, or feel free to ask me for personal help on Twitter (@daeha48), Reddit (u/daeha48), or email (markdsong48@gmail.com). </p>

            <a name="train"><big><b><p>Airport to Seoul Station via train</p></b></big></a>
            <p>If you plan on staying near Seoul station, you’re in luck. Getting to Seoul station is probably the easiest, and most fairly priced in terms of getting to and from the city through the AREX (Airport express). [On the terminal maps, look for “Express train” or “All-stop train” to look for where to go]</p>
            <p>I have yet to take the AREX myself actually because I’ve never needed to go to/from the airport from Seoul station, but it definitely is a good option if you are going to be near that area.</p>
            <p>Estimated time per the AREX website is 43 min from Terminal 1 and 51 minutes from Terminal 2. A ticket will set you back 9000 KRW (~8.4 USD), though I have read there is a 500 won deposit that you get back when you return the card, and that there’s a 100 won fee for a one way pass. Consider getting the round trip at the airport. [If you google it, a lot of blogs and websites have listed 8000 KRW as the ticket price, but I’m going off the AREX website]</p>
            <p>If you’re really penny pinching, there is an alternative:</p>
            <p>The AREX technically offers 2 lines. The express line, and the all stop line. Below is a map of the stops supported on the AREX all stop train. However, you won’t be able to purchase this ticket with a credit card, and you’re going to need a T-money card. The plus side is, T-money is the most important card in Korea-land, so it is not a loss to purchase one. You will need it anyway. The time cost isn’t bad either, the trip from Terminal 1 being 60 minutes, and Terminal 2 being about 66 minutes.</p>
            <p>Cost:</p>
            <p>Terminal 1 to Seoul station: 4150 KRW</p>
            <p>Terminal 2 to Seoul station: 4750 KRW</p>
            <p>If you are staying in Hongdae (aka Hongik university station), you can consider the AREX all stop train as well. 4050 KRW (from Terminal 1) / 4650KRW (from Terminal 2).</p>

            <a name="city_airport"><big><b><p>City to Airport</p></b></big></a>
            <b><p>City Air Terminal</p></b>
            <p>Not necessarily the most cost effective, but probably one of the most convenient that I’ve seen in any city, is the City Air Terminal or CAT (도심공항). It is located within the COEX complex in Gangnam, so if you are already near COEX, or can easily get to Samseong Station, go there. There’s also another location at Seoul station [ATTENTION: Read a notice that the Seoul Station CAT is temporarily not allowing early check-in for Korean Air since Feb 21, 2018, and Asiana  starting April 30, so there’s a good chance this service won’t be available].</p>
            <p>Note: You need to check-in at least 3 hours before your scheduled departure time. So take that into account if you are going to use the CAT</p>
            <p>You still have to end up leaving the city pretty early, as the bus will take the usual 40mins to 1 hour time to get the airport, but the perks of using the City Air Terminal is that you pre-emptively go through immigration, you straight to the airport, and most importantly because you already did immigration, you get to use a designated entrance at the airport for flight crew (really what that means is not going through TSA. But you still get your bags scanned, and someone still has to do your security clearance and let you into the terminal. But hey, save yourself one more line at the airport). I didn’t even worry about my checked luggage until I was back in America. </p>
            <p>The cost of the bus is 15,000 KRW (Roughly 14 USD). Even if you are not riding an airline supported by the City Air Terminal, you can still take these buses, so if you are staying in the Gangnam area, I’d still recommend this method of transportation. I’m actually not 100% sure, but if you have a flight later in the day, you could just check in, hang out in the city, and end up at the airport however you like.</p>
            <p>Depending on the time of day, a lot of people may be at the City Air Terminal, so come with the intent that your checkin will take about 20 minutes, and you might be waiting 20-40 minutes for the bus (Likely less). Make sure to check if you are riding an airline supported. Domestic Korean airlines, Sky Team airlines, and a few others are available in the list below (only for the COEX location):</p>

            <p><b>AREX</b> </p>
            <p>Pretty much just the opposite of my earlier post about getting from the Airport to Seoul station. Upon getting to Seoul station, look for the AREX signs, get your ticket (9000 KRW), and make your way to the express train to the airport!</p>
            <p>[ATTENTION: Read a notice that the Seoul Station CAT is temporarily not allowing early check-in for Korean Air since Feb 21, 2018, and Asiana starting April 30, so there’s a good chance this service won’t be available]</p>
